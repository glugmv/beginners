### How to contribute ?

Technically you can contribute in two ways
- Adding Questions: You can add questions in any of the given topics or you can add another folder for new language or topic. All the information about question should be added inside the `README.md` file inside the question folder or you can create a `sample.extension` file and describe the questions.
- Pushing Solutions: If you are a learner or want to practice then you can also push the code,`Try to comment the solution` which you got during the execution inside the solved file only. We will check it and if it's correct we will merge the solutions
